/*
Loop a Triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
*/

let result = '#';

for(let i = 0; i <= 6; i++) {
  console.log(`${result}\n`);
  result = `${result}#`;
  
}

/*
FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
"Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz
" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz"
or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
*/

for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

  if(i % 5 == 0 && i % 3 == 0) {
    console.log('fizzBuzz')
  }
  else if(i % 5 == 0){
    console.log('Buzz');
  }
  else if(i % 3 == 0) {
    console.log('fizz');
  }
  else console.log(i);

}

/*
Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

*/

let string = ' # # # #\n# # # # \n # # # #\n# # # # \n # # # #\n# # # # \n # # # #\n# # # # \n'
console.log(string);


/* 
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size,
outputting a grid of the given width and height.
*/



/*console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns
an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the
sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does
indeed return 55.


let numArray = [];
let accumulator = 0;


function sum(numArray) {
  return numArray.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);
}

function range(start, end) {
    for(let i = start; i <= end; i++)
    console.log(numArray.push(i));
    console.log(sum(numArray));
}

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
